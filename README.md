# reactstatemachine

Application built using React
Purpose of the app was to prove the concept of an array of states set to single useState hook and then being able to manipulate each state.
Application will calculate your viewport width, height and fill with small cubes.
Each cube has its own state and when clicked/hovered it will change state.
